Sezme Reviews: So that everyone who tells you "says who?" can hear you say, "Sezme!"

A project to create a website for reviews that anyone can post about pretty much anything at all. Written with Ruby on Rails, I worked on this for a long time, applying new skills as I learned them. It includes six models and complete user authentication functionality, plus countless hours of careful, if gaudy, web design.
